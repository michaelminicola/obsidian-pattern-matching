# Types of Pattern Matching

Pattern matching manifests in multiple forms across different cognitive domains and computational systems.

## By Sensory Modality

**Visual Patterns**
- Object recognition: identifying chairs, faces, letters
- Spatial patterns: navigation, layouts, arrangements
- Examples: Reading text, recognizing friends, finding your car in a lot

**Auditory Patterns**
- Speech recognition: phonemes, words, accents
- Music: melodies, rhythms, harmonies
- Examples: Understanding conversation, recognizing familiar songs

**Multimodal Patterns**
Multimodal patterns involve cross-sensory integration where the brain combines information from multiple senses. An example is the McGurk effect[1]. Visual information from lip movements can alter what we hear. When watching someone mouths the sound "ba", you can perceive it as "da", "ga", "va" or other similar sounds based on what lip movement is being shown to you. This demonstrates how pattern matching integrates audiovisual speech cues automatically.

## By Cognitive Level

### Perceptual Patterns
Low-level feature detection is handled automatically and unconsciously. This includes edge detection in vision and pitch discrimination in hearing, operating through rapid, unconscious processing.

### Conceptual Patterns
High-level abstract relationships involve mathematical patterns like sequences and symmetries, logical patterns such as if-then rules and cause-effect relationships, and analogical reasoning of the form "A is to B as C is to D".

### Social Patterns
Patterns in human behavior and interaction allow us to interpret facial expressions as emotions, body language as intentions, and conversation patterns as social norms.

## By Learning Origin

**Innate Patterns** (See [[Intrinsic vs Learned]])
- Face detection present at birth
- Basic spatial relationships
- Fundamental cause-effect understanding

**Learned Patterns**
- Reading and writing
- Domain expertise (chess, medicine, music)
- Cultural patterns and conventions

## By Temporal Structure

**Static Patterns**: Single snapshot (recognizing a photograph)
**Sequential Patterns**: Time-ordered (melodies, speech, action sequences)
**Cyclic Patterns**: Repeating regularities (seasons, circadian rhythms)

## Augmentation Through Pattern Types

Different pattern types support different cognitive functions. Perceptual patterns enable fast recognition and reaction, while conceptual patterns support problem-solving and reasoning. Social patterns facilitate communication and collaboration, and sequential patterns enable planning and prediction.
