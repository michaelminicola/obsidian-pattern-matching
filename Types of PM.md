# Types of Pattern Matching

Pattern matching manifests in multiple forms across different cognitive domains and computational systems.

## By Sensory Modality

**Visual Patterns**
- Object recognition: identifying chairs, faces, letters
- Spatial patterns: navigation, layouts, arrangements
- Examples: Reading text, recognizing friends, finding your car

**Auditory Patterns**
- Speech recognition: phonemes, words, accents
- Music: melodies, rhythms, harmonies
- Examples: Understanding language, recognizing songs

**Multimodal Patterns**
- Cross-sensory integration
- Audiovisual speech (McGurk effect)
- Examples: Watching someone speak, playing musical instruments

## By Cognitive Level

### Perceptual Patterns
Low-level feature detection handled automatically
- Edge detection in vision
- Pitch discrimination in hearing
- Rapid, unconscious processing

### Conceptual Patterns
High-level abstract relationships
- Mathematical patterns: sequences, symmetries
- Logical patterns: if-then rules, cause-effect
- Analogical reasoning: "A is to B as C is to D"

### Social Patterns
Patterns in human behavior and interaction
- Facial expressions → emotions
- Body language → intentions
- Conversation patterns → social norms

## By Learning Origin

**Innate Patterns** (See [[Intrinsic vs Learned]])
- Face detection present at birth
- Basic spatial relationships
- Fundamental cause-effect understanding

**Learned Patterns**
- Reading and writing
- Domain expertise (chess, medicine, music)
- Cultural patterns and conventions

## By Temporal Structure

**Static Patterns**: Single snapshot (recognizing a photograph)
**Sequential Patterns**: Time-ordered (melodies, speech, action sequences)
**Cyclic Patterns**: Repeating regularities (seasons, circadian rhythms)

## Augmentation Through Pattern Types

Different pattern types support different cognitive functions:
- **Perceptual** → Fast recognition and reaction
- **Conceptual** → Problem-solving and reasoning
- **Social** → Communication and collaboration
- **Sequential** → Planning and prediction
