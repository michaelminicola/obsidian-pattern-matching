Stereotypes have strong connection with Pattern Matching. In the "Untested assumptions perpetuate stereotyping: Learning in the absence of evidence" article, the authors explain how stereotypes form. They explain what is called "External Hebbian Learning": "When neuron or neural cluster _A_ is activated immediately before neuron/neural cluster _B_, spike-timing-dependent plasticity strengthens the synaptic connections from _A_ to _B_. This Hebbian synaptic strengthening is most commonly discussed in terms of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic activations both being initiated by external stimuli (e.g., stimulus A activates _A,_ then stimulus B activates _B_, thus _A_ → _B_ is strengthened)." [1] This process can be visualized through the following diagram:

They then move on to explaining "Inferential Hebbian Learning", which simply says that if one concept occurs as a stimulus (e.g. concept *A*), which already had a pre-existing association due to the previous process, lead to an inference, strengthening the association between them. [1] This can also be explained by the following diagram:

How this related to stereotyping is that when someone makes a stereotypic inference, Inferential Hebbian Learning will strengthen this stereotype even if no evidence is present to support it. And the more this association happens, the more the stereotype strengthens. [1] 

In the article, they explain a study that they have done in which they brought 3 groups of people, with different stereotypes. For the first group, they "confirmed" their stereotype (e.g. _A_ → _B_). For the second, they "disconfirmed" (e.g. _A_ → $not$ _B_). For the third, they gave no feedback. The results then showed that participants in the of the first and third groups stereotyped more over time, while those in the second group remained unchanged. The third group not receiving any confirmatory feedback but still increase in stereotyping overtime is an indication that they "learned from their own untested assumptions" [1]. Moreover, the fact that those in group 2 did not have lower stereotypic rates even though they were provided with disconfirming evidence shows that "stereotype-confirming evidence carried more weight than stereotype-disconfirming evidence". [1]
