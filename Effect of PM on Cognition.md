## Cognitive Benefits
### Chunking and Memory
When we recognize patterns we can group related information to create mental frameworks described in [[Development of PM]]. This is known as chunking. Chess masters use chunking by recognizing familiar board positions instead of analyzing each piece individually. This allows them to hold more information in memory.
### Decision Making
Once we know a pattern well we can react almost automatically without any actual analysis. We use these learned patterns to solve problems and more efficiently handle situations especially through practice methods in [[Enhancing PM]].
### Learning and Generalization
We learn through pattern matching. Once we have identified and understood a pattern we can apply it across a ton of different contexts and transfer skills between the categories talked about in [[Types of PM]].
## Common Mistakes
### Seeing False Patterns
Sometimes we see patterns when they aren't actually there and this is called apophenia. Some examples of this are when you see faces in clouds or how believing that certain numbers are lucky.
### Overgeneralization and Bias
Pattern matching allows us to speed up our thinking and can make thinking more "efficient". We shouldn't rely on patterns for everything though as it is can have some downsides but it is extremely valuable for learning and predicting.
## Summary
Pattern matching allows us to think faster and more efficiently but we have to be careful not to trust patterns blindly. It’s a great mental tool that can help us learn, understand and act on them.
