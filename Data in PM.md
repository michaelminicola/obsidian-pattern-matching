# Data in PM

Pattern matching in huge datasets is a critical challenge in this new era of immense amounts of data at your finger tips.  Developing models that are able to identify these patterns reliably remains a distinct problem, which forces you to ask the question "how is the human brain so good at identifying patterns"[1].  These large systems are using sophisticated models and complicated benchmark tests to identify how we can create more accurate pattern matching models[2].  


# Pattern Matching in Machine Learning

The usage of AI in pattern matching is also discussed more specifically here [[AI and The Human Brain]]
## Necessary Data
It has been proven that the quality of the images that these models are being trained on is extremely important when it comes to the performance of the model.  These high quality images allow the models to identify the subtle details that would not be visible in lower quality images [1]. 

## Image Clustering
One techinque that these models are trained on is the clustering of pixels, and the repeated patterns of these pixels.  If there is a specific cluster of pixels for specific cases, like front verse side of a face, the models are trained to pickup on these clusters[2].

# Pattern Matching in Humans

Humans are extremely accurate at predicting the mood of others with a 98% correct rate for human happiness[2].  See more about this in [[PM in Facial Expressions]]

## Human Abilities

Humans are naturally extremely good at identifying patterns with little training.  These human specialties are often used to check the validity of the machine learning models in order to deem their accuracy.  

## Reliability Over Time

Humans are also consistent with their answers over time, tending to fall back to the same answers that they had originally decided on[2]. Humans are able to naturally able to integrate context into their pattern matching 

# Humans vs Machine Learning

| Aspect         | Humans                 | Machine Learning Models         |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Data Needed    | Few examples           | Thousands to millions           |
| Flexibility    | High across situations | Often narrow to training data   |
| Generalization | Strong                 | Weak outside trained conditions |
| Speed          | Fast                   | Fast but needs preprocessing    |


# Summary
Researchers are studying the human brain to attempt and identify what it is thats making humans so good at identifying patterns[2].  The pattern matching abilities of machine learning models is improving rapidly, however the requirements for a lot of the implementations would require near perfect implementation.  This leads the researchers to continue studying and testing different techniques, in hopes of improving these abilities.
