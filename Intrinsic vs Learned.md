Pattern matching abilities can come naturally (intrinsic) or developed with experience (learned). This is a combination that gets built into the pathways in [[Development of PM]]. Both of these combine into shaping how we interact with the world.
## Intrinsic Pattern Matching
### In Humans
Babies prefer looking at faces and can tell emotions early on. This shows that some biases are wired into the circuits in [[PM in The Human Brain]]. Research shows parts of the brain are hard wired for detecting faces which shows that early on the brain can start recognizing social and visual patterns.
### In AI
Some AI systems have prebuilt structures that help them recognize certain patterns like how vision systems are designed to look for edges which is discussed in [[PM in Technologies]]. Most of the pattern matching comes from learning though.
## Learned Pattern Matching
### In Humans
Most pattern skills like reading or playing music are learned through practice. The brain gets better at recognizing patterns with time as seen in [[Enhancing PM]] and the behavioural shifts talked about in [[Measuring PM]]. As we come across more examples of things our brain can categorize them into patterns to improve our understanding. For example as a scientist we can learn to better detect trends in data which is learned.
### In AI
AI learns patterns from data. For example it learns to recognize animals by looking at thousands of pictures. It can take in these images labeled and train off of their pre defined categories. It often needs reviewing or categorizing to be trained.
## Working Together
Both built in and learned pattern recognition are important and deeply connected. Built in skills give a good starting point and learning builds on that to improve pattern recognition. This combination is what makes human brains so powerful and flexible. We are not limited to hard wired patterns we are born with but they provide a great starting point.
## Summary
Some pattern abilities you are born with while others are learned over time. Together they help both humans and machines get better at recognizing patterns with continual improvement.
