Language is one of the most important things in human relationships, and the main way in which humans communicate. In "Linguistic Style Matching in Social Interaction" article, the authors talk about how people unconsciously adapt the language style (i.e. patterns) from the people surrounding them, which they call Linguistic Style Matching (LSM). In the study, they conducted three experiment. In the first two, students talked to each other through an online chat forum, not in-person. In the third experiment, they looked at real historical transcripts between people. In all three experiments, they found that people exhibit LSM, both on the conversation level and turn-by-turn level, even if they had no emotional connection to each other. For example, if one person tends to use more articles or preposition in the way they talk, the other person is likely to start doing so as well. This can be referred to as cognitive coordination.
