# Enhancing Pattern Matching Through Perceptual Learning 

Perceptual learning is defined as the ability to enhance our ability to interpret the world around us based off of our own personal experiences[1].  Our ability to percieve and predict patterns stems from living through similar situations and witnessing what occurences took place and if they will take place again.  We are able to use this to distinguish rare events, with those that are no longer rare and become pattern.  Perceptual learning is an extremely important mechanism for studying learning and memory [1].  

# Mechanism of Enhancement

## Repetition
Improving your sensory processing typically takes lots of repetitive practice and happens on different scales.  Research shows training through these repeated tasks can sharpen the way that we observe basic features in things like line spacing, tilt, color shades, etc. It also aids in our understanding of how we percieve more complex objects such as facial expressions [[PM in Facial Expressions]], telling car models based on niche details, finding tumors in x-rays, etc[2].  These patterns are recognized and learned from through repeated life experiences as we grow [[Development of PM]] and train ourselves[1].  

## Memory Reactivation
There have been many studies that have aimed to identify if re-envoking memories could aid in training our brains to remember[2].  The study aimed to identify if there was a window of opportunity during memory ingestion that could be utilized to re-activate the material you learned and see if your brain could more easily ingest and remember.  Althogh the studies found this to be useful, one study found that the improvement was less significant than full our repetition in the task[2].  

## Necessary Conditions 

# Attention
Attention to a task is extremely beneficial for developing pattern recognition abilities in the sense of identifying, understanding, and rememebering the subject.  Although, it has been shown that it is not necessary[1].  The background noise of pattern recognition can still settle in your brain without you even realizing it.  Think of yourself always walking past blue billboards on your way to school and never thinking about it, once the billboard turns red you are able to identify the shift in the pattern without consciously thinking about it.  

# Reward Based Learning
Recieving a reward for your efforts has been proven to boost perceptual learning abilities[1].  This is caused by the release of dopamine when accomplishing the task, which is central in reforcement learning [1].
