Human relationships is an essential part of any human's life. Think of how many humans you see in a single day, whether they are coworkers, classmates, friends, or even random people in the street. Every human interaction is a form of input to the human brain, and with inputs come patterns. 

In their article, "Thin Slices of Expressive Behavior as Predictors of Interpersonal Consequences: A Meta-Analysis", the authors explain that many of the judgements we make about people in our everyday lives are based on a collection of cues, including the way they talk, move, and their facial expressions. In other words, a collection of cue patterns. Not only that, but these judgements are often accurate even when they are based on brief observations. Judgments from under 30 seconds of observation were as accurate as those made from 5-min observations. Sometimes, there were better results from brief observations than long ones, which "contradicts the commonsense notion that more information leads to greater accuracy; the additional information might be redundant, or even counterproductive". [1] 

In one of the experiments, strangers were shown a 5-minute video clips of strangers, and not only was the above confirmed, but also the feelings that arose from the fleeting glimpses of behavior in these clips had "some basis in reality" [1]. Findings indicate the people are fairly accurate at identifying emotions from exposures to nonverbal behavior lasting only 375 milliseconds. 

One of the findings that might seem surprising is that sometimes "people make better judgments when they rely on their intuition rather than when they introspect or reason" [1].

-------------------

Another crucial aspect in human relationships is language. In [[PM in Language]], we focus on how people talking to each other impacts both of their speaking style, as discussed in the "Linguistic Style Matching in Social Interaction" article. [2]

------------
One of the things that affect people's relationships with each other, especially those they are unfamiliar with, is stereotypes. A stereotype refers to "a set idea that people have about what someone or something is like, especially an idea that is wrong" [3] . Turns out that stereotypes are strongly related to Pattern Matching. In [[PM and Stereotypes]], we explain how stereotypes form and their effect on cognitive inference.

All of the above connects to Pattern Matching in the Human Brain ([[PM in The Human Brain]]), since they are all cognitive functions.
