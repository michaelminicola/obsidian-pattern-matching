# Measuring Pattern Matching

Measuring pattern recognition starts with having clear definitions which are outlines in [[Pattern Matching Overview]] for the building blocks we are looking at. Researchers takes these definitions and pair them with tasks like search grids, learning games and memory tests to score the accuracy, speed and error rate. They also track across ages also shows how the age can change pattern matching in [[Development of PM]].

Human assessments are often paired with neurological assessments. Neuroscientists combine EEG/MEG tests with fMRI mappings to see how strongly the pathways in the brain respond to stimuli. This can show us how much effort is being put into pattern matching and if it is automatic. This can be seen in [[PM in The Human Brain]].

Machines need their own tests and metrics to track pattern matching.  Benchmarks are used like confusion matrices and precision/recall curves to look at if the technologies in [[PM in Technologies]] are actually pattern matching correctly.
## Human Tests
### Raven’s Matrices
These matrices have people complete visual patterns and it shows how well someone can solve pattern problems.
### Memory and Speed Tasks
A common test is memorizing a sequence of symbols or hidden tile matching games. The persons speed and accuracy are then tracked and this relates to how good they are at pattern matching.
### Brain Scans
Scientists can use EEG or fMRI to directly look at brain activity when pattern matching and show which pathways are firing and how much brain activity it is taking.
## Machine Tests
### Accuracy and Error Rate
AI systems are very concretely tested on correct or wrong in matching patterns. Their accuracy rate then determines their strength of pattern matching. 
### Generalization
Well built systems are able to recognize patterns across new introduced data and not only just on the data it was trained on. This is a common problem with simple pattern matching algorithms where they are only able to detect patterns on data it was trained on or very similar data.
## Summary
Both machines and humans come down to accuracy and speed in pattern matching to measure effectiveness.
