# Development of Pattern Matching

Pattern matching capabilities become increasily complex during human growth due to the quick expansion of the cerebral cortex.  This pattern recognition stems from previous experiences which is used to construct new patterns in the brain and predict the outcomes of future events.  As humans undergo their different life experiences, they are able to experience new things both physically and emotionally which alter the individuals pattern recognition.[1]

# Stages of Pattern Processing 

# Infancy

## Basic Recognition
It is said that from birth, individuals possess the evolutionary ability to distinguish individuals and their emotional state just based on their faces.[1]

## Early Language
Understanding the meaning of pointing and gestures is an early display of understanding patterns before the individuals are able to speak.  Before the infants are able to communicate verbally, they are able to use a much more simple but yet meaningful way of communication.[1]

# Early Childhood

## Language Mastery
Language is the most substantial example of pattern recognition in humans.  From early stages to language mastery, learning involves chemical and structural changes changes in synapses in your brain which are developed from language repetition.  In other words, your brain physically changes in order to better understand the patterns of language and how to communicate effectively.[1]

## Experience Dependent Expansion
Training in certain areas, can lead to an expansion of your pattern matching abilities.  For instance, in a study it was shown that children who had music training were able to identify improved abilities to detect sound patterns than those who did not have that training[1].  

This is just a couple out of the many different types of pattern recognition.  See [[Types of PM]] for the others that are developed in this phase.  

# Aging and Decline

## Normal Aging
As individuals become older, there is often a decrement in their pattern matching abilites.  Their brains are not able to detect patterns in the same way that they could originally, this could lead to things such as age related memory deficits as they become older.

## Neurodegeneration
In Alzherimer's, the synapses and neurons begin to degenerate in the cerebral cortex, resulting in a large loss to individuals pattern matching capabilities.  This degeneration can come in many forms as pattern matching is one of the most crucial aspects of ones neural function.  

# Summary
During all stages of your life, your brain in identifying patterns and predicting the outcomes of events based on these patterns that you have experienced.  As you will never stop having new experiences till the day you die, your brain will constantly be identifying these and storing them.  For ways to help enhance your pattern matching abilities, refer to [[Enhancing PM]].
